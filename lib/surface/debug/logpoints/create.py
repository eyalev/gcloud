          This command adds a debug logpoint to a debug target. Logpoints add
          logging to your running service without changing your code or
          restarting your application. When you create a logpoint, the message
          you specify will be added to your logs whenever any instance of your
          service executes the specified line of code.

          The default lifetime of a logpoint is 24 hours from creation, and the
          output will go to the standard log for the programming language of the
          target (java.logging for Java, logging.* for Python, etc.)

            The logpoint location. Locations are of
            the form FILE:LINE, where FILE can be simply the file name, or the
            file name preceded by enough path components to differentiate it
            from other files with the same name. It is an error to provide a
            file name that is not unique in the debug target.

            A format string which will be logged every time the logpoint
            location is executed. If the string contains curly braces ('{' and
            '}'), any text within the curly braces will be interpreted as a
            run-time expression in the debug target's language, which will be
            evaluated when the logpoint is hit.

            The value of the expression will then replace the {} expression in
            the resulting log output. For example, if you specify the format
            string "a={a}, b={b}", and the logpoint is hit when local variable
            a is 1 and b is 2, the resulting log output would be "a=1, b=2".
