      'DESCRIPTION': """\
          This command creates a debug snapshot on a Cloud Debugger debug
          target. Snapshots allow you to capture stack traces and local
          variables from your running service without interfering with normal
          operations.

          When any instance of the target executes the snapshot location, the
          optional condition expression is evaluated. If the result is true
          (or if there is no condition), the instance captures the current
          thread state and reports it back to Cloud Debugger. Once any instance
          captures a snapshot, the snapshot is marked as completed, and it
          will not be captured again.

          You can most easily view snapshot results in the developer console. It
          is also possible to inspect snapshot results with the "snapshots
          describe" command.
